# Workshop: Water Quality Modeling with CE-QUAL-W2

## Date: July 18 - 20, 2023

Engineers, scientists, researchers, and planners are invited to participate in the CE-QUAL-W2 Water Quality Modeling Workshop, a comprehensive training program designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in reservoir and river water quality modeling. Hosted by the Environmental Laboratory (EL) of the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), this three-day workshop will take place July 18 - 20, 2023. The course coordinator is Ms. Lauren Melendez from ERDC-EL.

This workshop is made possible through the support of the the USACE HH&C SET numerical model maintenance program and the ERDC's Ecosystem Management and Restoration Research Program, which recognize the significance of CE-QUAL-W2 in improving the management and protection of water resources worldwide. The course instructors are Dr. Todd Steissberg (ERDC-EL, Lead Developer of CE-QUAL-W2), Dr. Barry Bunch (ERDC-EL), Dr. Zhonglong Zhang (Portland State University and LimnoTech), Mr. Isaac Mudge (USACE New Orleans District & ERDC-EL), Dr. Andy Goodwin (ERDC-EL), and Dr. Billy Johnson (LimnoTech).

The workshop will be conducted in a hybrid format, accommodating both in-person and remote participants. Through a combination of lectures, demonstrations, and practical exercises, participants will gain a solid foundation in water quality modeling and acquire the necessary skills to set up, calibrate, and simulate CE-QUAL-W2 models for various water bodies.

CE-QUAL-W2 is a state-of-the-art, two-dimensional (2D), longitudinal/vertical hydrodynamic and water quality model specifically designed to capture dynamic changes within reservoirs. With over 300 applications worldwide, this widely used model has contributed invaluable insights into the flow dynamics and water quality conditions of reservoirs, lakes, rivers, and estuaries. By facilitating environmental impact assessments, informing reservoir operations decision-making, and supporting the planning, design, and evaluation of water resources systems and infrastructure, CE-QUAL-W2 has become an essential tool in addressing both national and global environmental challenges.

Furthermore, recent enhancements to the model have expanded its capabilities, enabling more detailed modeling of phenomena such as Total Dissolved Gas (TDG), sediment diagenesis, and the buoyancy, rise, and fall of algae. Notably, the prediction of variable velocity of cyanobacteria has advanced the simulation of Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) conditions, proving particularly useful. These enhancements make CE-QUAL-W2 an even more powerful resource for tackling complex water quality issues.
