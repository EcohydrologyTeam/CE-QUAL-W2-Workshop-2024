# Workshop: Water Quality Modeling with CE-QUAL-W2

## Date: July 8 - 9, 2024

Engineers, scientists, researchers, and planners are invited to participate in the CE-QUAL-W2 Water Quality Modeling Workshop, a comprehensive training program designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in reservoir and river water quality modeling. Hosted by the Environmental Laboratory (EL) of the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), this three-day workshop will take place July 8 - 9, 2024. The course coordinator is Ms. Lauren Melendez from ERDC-EL.

This workshop is made possible through the support of:

1. The USACE Scientific and Engineering Technology (SET) numerical model maintenance program, managed under the Hydrology, Hydraulics, and Coastal Community of Practice (HH&C CoP)
2. ERDC's Ecosystem Management and Restoration Research Program (EMRRP; https://emrrp.el.erdc.dren.mil/)
3. ERDC's Aquatic Nuisance Species Research Program (ANSRP; https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Aquatic-Nuisance-Species-Research-Program/)

These programs recognize the significance of CE-QUAL-W2 in improving the management and protection of water resources worldwide, supporting maintenance and ongoing development to improve and extend the capabilities of CE-QUAL-W2.

The course instructors are Dr. Todd Steissberg (ERDC-EL, Lead Developer of CE-QUAL-W2), and Lauren Melendez (ERDC-EL)

The workshop will be conducted in a hybrid format, accommodating both in-person and remote participants. Through a combination of lectures, demonstrations, and practical exercises, participants will gain a solid foundation in water quality modeling and acquire the necessary skills to set up, calibrate, and simulate CE-QUAL-W2 models for various water bodies.

CE-QUAL-W2 is a state-of-the-art, two-dimensional (2D), longitudinal/vertical hydrodynamic and water quality model specifically designed to capture dynamic changes within reservoirs. With over 300 applications worldwide, this widely used model has contributed invaluable insights into the flow dynamics and water quality conditions of reservoirs, lakes, rivers, and estuaries. By facilitating environmental impact assessments, informing reservoir operations decision-making, and supporting the planning, design, and evaluation of water resources systems and infrastructure, CE-QUAL-W2 has become an essential tool in addressing both national and global environmental challenges.

Furthermore, recent enhancements to the model have expanded its capabilities, enabling more detailed modeling of phenomena such as Total Dissolved Gas (TDG), sediment diagenesis, and the buoyancy, rise, and fall of algae. Notably, the prediction of variable velocity of cyanobacteria has advanced the simulation of Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) conditions, proving particularly useful. These enhancements make CE-QUAL-W2 an even more powerful resource for tackling complex water quality issues.
